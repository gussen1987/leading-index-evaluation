# Regime Classification Configuration

# Thresholds for regime classification
thresholds:
  risk_on: 0.50          # Composite > threshold → Risk-On
  risk_off: -0.50        # Composite < threshold → Risk-Off
  hysteresis_buffer: 0.15  # Must cross threshold ± buffer to exit
  min_weeks_in_regime: 2   # Minimum weeks before switching

# Confidence scoring weights (must sum to 1.0)
confidence_weights:
  dispersion: 0.60       # Fraction of blocks agreeing with composite sign
  tail_penalty: 0.20     # Penalty when VIX/VVIX elevated
  liquidity_penalty: 0.20  # Penalty when NFCI > 0

# Tail and liquidity thresholds
tail_liquidity:
  vix_z_threshold: 1.5     # VIX z-score above this triggers penalty
  vvix_z_threshold: 1.5    # VVIX z-score above this triggers penalty
  nfci_threshold: 0.0      # NFCI above this triggers penalty
